Welcome! I am a post-doctoral researcher in economics at the [University of Bergen](https://www.uib.no/econ]), Norway. I am also an associate member of the Bergen Center for Competition Law and Economics \([BECCLE](https://beccle.no/)\).   

My research explores the economics of:

-   Financial Technology (FinTech)
-   Blockchain & Cryptocurrencies
-   Capital Markets
-   Corporate Finance
-   Industrial Organization

I specialize in the empirical analysis of massively large datasets using R, Python, and SQL.  

I also teach a final-year undergraduate course [ITØK 264: Financial Technology](https://www.uib.no/emne/IT%C3%98K264).  

I obtained my PhD in applied economics from Ghent University, Belgium in 2017. I also spent two years as a Barclays research fellow in finance at the Saïd Business School, University of Oxford, United Kingdom.
