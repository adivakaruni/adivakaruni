Welcome! I am a post-doctoral researcher in economics at the [University of Bergen](https://www.uib.no/econ]), Norway. I am also an associate member of the Bergen Center for Competition Law and Economics \([BECCLE](https://beccle.no/)\).   

My research explores the economics of:

-   Financial Technology (FinTech)
-   Blockchain & Cryptocurrencies
-   Capital Markets
-   Corporate Finance
-   Industrial Organization

I specialize in the empirical analysis of massively large datasets using R, Python, and SQL.  

I also teach a final-year undergraduate course [ITØK 264: Financial Technology](https://www.uib.no/emne/IT%C3%98K264).  

I obtained my PhD in applied economics from [Ghent University](https://www.ugent.be/eb/en), Belgium in 2017. I also spent two years as a Barclays research fellow in finance at the [Saïd Business School](https://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/), [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/), United Kingdom.

    <details style="color:#14213d" align="justify">
        <summary style="color:blue">Abstract</summary>
        In April 2020, the US government sent economic impact payments (EIPs) directly to households, as part of its measures to address the COVID-19 pandemic. We characterize these stimulus checks as a wealth shock for households and examine their effect on retail trading in Bitcoin. We find a significant increase in Bitcoin buy trades for the modal EIP amount of $1,200. The rise in Bitcoin trading is highest among individuals without families and at exchanges catering to nonprofessional investors. We estimate that the EIP program has a significant but modest effect on the US dollar–Bitcoin trading pair, increasing trade volume by about 3.8 percent. Trades associated with the EIPs result in a slight rise in the price of Bitcoin of 7 basis points. Nonetheless, the increase in trading is small compared to the size of the stimulus check program, representing only 0.02 percent of all EIP dollars. We repeat our analysis for other countries with similar stimulus programs and find an increase in Bitcoin buy trades in these currencies. Our findings highlight how wealth shocks affect retail trading.

        <summary style="color:blue">Abstract</summary>
        The Lightning Network (LN) is a means of netting Bitcoin payments outside the blockchain. We find a significant association between LN adoption and reduced blockchain congestion, suggesting that the LN has helped improve the efficiency of Bitcoin as a means of payment. This improvement cannot be explained by other factors, such as changes in demand or the adoption of SegWit. We find mixed evidence on whether increased centralisation in the Lightning Network has improved its efficiency. Our findings have implications for the future of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment and their environmental footprint.

    <details style="color:#14213d" align="justify">
        <summary style="color:blue">Abstract</summary>
        We investigate how information flows within bank networks facilitate syndicate formation and lending in the leveraged buyout (LBO) market, where relationships between banks and borrowers are scarce and borrower opacity is high. Using novel measures that characterize a bank's ability to source and disseminate information within its loan syndication network, we show that the extent of this capability influences which banks join the syndicate, the share the lead bank holds, and LBO borrowing terms. Banks' ability to source and disseminate network-based information is particularly useful when ties to prospective borrowers are lacking, with the information flows extending beyond knowledge on PE firms and LBO targets.

        <summary style="color:blue">Abstract</summary>
        We document public welfare spending as an important growth driver of FinTech lending. Examining the massive austerity-led cuts to local welfare spending initiated by the UK government in 2010, we show that the gradual uneven rollback of the local welfare state since then is strongly associated with a rise in demand for peer-to-peer (P2P) consumer loans among affected areas, primarily in areas facing more banking and digital exclusion. P2P loans issued in austerity-affected areas are more expensive compared to those issued in unaffected areas, consistent with the P2P platform's risk pricing sensitivity to higher default rates in affected areas. Overall, our findings show that P2P lending, as an alternative means to household finance, can help smooth cuts in welfare transfers particularly among households in economically deprived areas.

    <details style="color:#14213d" align="justify">
        <summary style="color:blue">Abstract</summary>
        U.S. firms which go public under the JOBS Act benefit from disclosure exemptions, but on average these last for only two years. We study the impact on the investments and growth opportunities of these firms when they move to mandatory disclosure. After losing their exemptions, firms raise less equity relative to debt and invest less in physical assets, innovation, and acquisitions. At the same time, they exhibit better allocation of equity to investments, better utilization of existing assets, and improvements in Tobin’s q. These findings suggest that disclosure-exempt firms prioritise investment, but those subject to stricter disclosure requirements make more efficient investment decisions.
